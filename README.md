# Simulation and Optimization of G/M/1 Queue in Delivery Services Using Variations in Arrival Distributions
This project simulated a G/M/1 queue system to evaluate the performance and operational efficiency of a fast delivery service under varying arrival time distributions. Customer arrivals were divided into three time periods with different characteristics: a normal distribution during peak hours (09.00–12.00), exponential during off-peak hours (12.00–18.00), and uniform distribution at night (18.00–24.00). Each package processing time followed an exponential distribution with an average of 2 minutes. The simulation considered a single courier working 15 hours per day with operational costs, delivery revenues, and penalties for delays exceeding 15 minutes.

The simulation produced detailed metrics including average waiting time, queue length, delay probability, daily operational cost, and net profit. Results showed that peak-hour delays were significant, with an average waiting time of 30 minutes and a 38.8% delay rate. Despite this, the company could still generate a net daily profit of IDR 1.74 million. Three improvement scenarios were tested: (1) increasing night-time package volume due to promotions, (2) adding an extra courier during peak hours, and (3) reducing operating hours from 15 to 12 per day. The best results were achieved in scenario 2, which significantly reduced delays and increased net profit to IDR 2.05 million.

This project highlighted the importance of simulation in strategic operations planning. It provided actionable insights for balancing cost efficiency, service quality, and profit in delivery logistics.
